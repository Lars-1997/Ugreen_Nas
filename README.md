# Ugreen_Nas

Plan:
- Create Python File: :white_check_mark:
  - Create a List of all Files in the first Folder :white_check_mark:
  - Create a List of all Files in the second Folder :white_check_mark:
  - Create a List of all Files in the third Folder :white_check_mark:
  - Compare List one and three, and List two and three :white_check_mark:
  - Remove objects that are in the List three :white_check_mark:
  - Compare the remaining objects in List one and two :white_check_mark:
  - Move all the remaining items on List one and two to the position of list three :white_check_mark:
- Create a Docker build of that Skript 
  - Create a dockerfile that works and moves images from one folder to another :white_check_mark:
  - Create a setupfile so that the variables do not have to be handeled manually
- Figure out how to schedule the Docker Build to run every day, even when the Nas is restarted every day

Possible Improvements
- Python File
  - Make that lists one and two are compared to list three simulatnius (Not sure how big the impact is)
