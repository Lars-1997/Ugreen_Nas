# Ugreen_Nas

Plan:
- Create Python File:
  - Create a List of all Files in the first Folder
  - Create a List of all Files in the second Folder
  - Create a List of all Files in the third Folder
  - Compare List one and three, and List two and three
  - Remove objects that are in the List three
  - Compare the remaining objects in List one and two
  - Move all the remaining items on List one and two to the position of list three
- Create a Docker build of that Skript
- Figure out how to schedule the Docker Build to run every day, even when the Nas is restarted every day
